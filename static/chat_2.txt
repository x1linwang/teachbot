User: Hi again? What is objective function in this course?

Chatbot: Hello! In this course, the objective function refers to the function that you are trying to optimize or minimize in order to achieve a specific goal. It is an essential component in machine learning and AI models as it defines the criteria for success or failure in the optimization process. The objective function could be based on minimizing error, maximizing accuracy, or achieving a certain outcome based on the data and model being used. It helps guide the learning process and decision-making in AI algorithms.
